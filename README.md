4. Ticket Resolution: The support agent resolves the issue or fulfills the request described in the ticket. This could involve providing a solution, answering a question, or completing a task.

5. Ticket Closure: After the issue has been resolved or the request has been fulfilled, the ticket is marked as closed. This indicates that the support process for that particular issue is complete.

Ticket Follow-up (Optional): In some cases, after the ticket is closed, there may be a follow-up process to ensure that the resolution provided meets the user's expectations or to gather feedback on the support experience.
